# FractionalDiffusion

This project is intended to provide a basic implementation of the reduced basis algorithms presented in the paper "A Reduced Basis Method for Fractional Diffusion Operators I" by Tobias Danczul and Joachim Sch√∂berl. The repository contains two Jupyter Notebook that walk the reader through the code:

- FractionalNorm.ipynb, containing a basic implementation of the reduced basis interpolation norm,
- FractionalOperator.ipynb, containing a basic implementation of the reduced basis operator.
  
To execute these files, you need to install Netgen/NGSolve on your local machine, see https://ngsolve.org/ for details.
